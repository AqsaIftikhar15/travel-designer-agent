# üåç Travel Designer Agent

**Travel Designer Agent** is a smart, multi-agent travel planning assistant built using the [OpenAI Agent SDK](https://openai.com/blog/assistants-api) and powered by OpenRouter models. It helps users choose travel destinations based on their mood, book flights, and explore local attractions ‚Äî all through a conversational UI built with **Streamlit**.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The user selects their **mood** (e.g., adventurous, relaxing, romantic).
2. The `DestinationAgent` suggests suitable travel spots.
3. The user picks one destination and proceeds to **book a trip**.
4. The `BookingAgent` shows flight options.
5. After selecting a flight, the `ExploreAgent` recommends things to do at that location.

All interactions happen live inside the Streamlit app.
